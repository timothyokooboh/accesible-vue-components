# avc
A collection of accessible and reusable user interface components currently being created with Vue 3, TypeScript and TailwindCSS.

## Components created so far include:
- Accordion
- Alert

## Documentation
I am using storybook to document the usage of each component.
The link to the storybook documentation can be found <a href="https://practical-vuejs-course-prep-ui-library.vercel.app/">here.</a>
